## Code Examples

### Data Types
This section demonstrates Python's basic data types: int, float, str, list, tuple, set, and dict.
# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age)

# Float
height = 5.9
print("Height:", height)

# String
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name)

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("Fruits:", fruits)

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)

# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}
print("Unique numbers:", unique_numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print("Person:", person)

---

### Loops
This section demonstrates for and while loops.

#### for Loop# Iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

#### while Loop# Countdown from 5 to 1
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1

---

### Conditionals
This section demonstrates if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements.

#### if Statementx = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

#### if-else Statementx = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

#### if-elif-else Statementx = 7
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

---

### Comprehensions
This section demonstrates list, dictionary, and set comprehensions.

#### List Comprehension# Create a list of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print("Squares:", squares)

#### Dictionary Comprehension# Create a dictionary of squares
squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
print("Squares Dictionary:", squares_dict)

#### Set Comprehension# Create a set of unique squares
squares_set = {x**2 for x in range(-3, 4)}
print("Squares Set:", squares_set)

---

## Usage
To use the examples, simply run the Python scripts in your terminal or IDE. Each script demonstrates a specific concept, and the output is printed to the console.

For example, to run the data types example:python data_types.py
